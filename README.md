# EntropySimulation
This is just a minimal and simple entropy simulation

**EntropySimulation** is a mini universe simulation that models **entropy, momentum, and local interactions**. The project creates a small experimental "universe" where you can observe the emergence of order and chaos over time.

## Features

- **Entropy simulation:** Each object computes the local entropy of its surroundings and moves based on that value.
- **Objects and types:** 10 different object types (A–J) with distinct mass and entropy resistance values.
- **Momentum:** Objects remember their previous movement, creating smoother and more natural dynamics.
- **Local interactions:** Objects can swap positions, cluster, or resist movement based on their properties.
- **Proto-gravity:** A simple mechanism simulates attraction between objects, enhancing clustering behavior.
- **Dynamic evolution:** Starting from a regular grid, patterns naturally emerge as the simulation evolves over time.
- **SDL2 rendering:** Independent rendering layer for visualizing the simulation in real time.
